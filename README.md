System Analysis &amp; Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client, DriverPass, sought to develop a comprehensive platform to assist individuals in successfully passing their driving exams on their initial attempt. The envisioned system was designed with tiered user levels, each providing access to diverse content tailored to enhance exam preparation. Additionally, users were empowered to schedule both in-person training sessions and behind-the-wheel lessons conducted by certified instructors. The system's overarching objective was to efficiently coordinate these activities, offering users a seamless experience while granting administrators specialized functions. Notably, administrators were equipped with the capability to deactivate specific packages that were no longer intended to be offered, ensuring a streamlined and adaptive service structure.

What did you do particularly well?
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I effectively turned the project requirements from interviews into a clear set of use cases. I carefully mapped out how different actions connect and made sure each user has the right access to certain functions. This created a polished and organized plan for how the project will work, showcasing a solid grasp of how users will interact with the system and the details of how it will function. As for what I would change, I would consider revising my sequence diagram, especially since I've identified what seems to be a nested structure with two "alternative" sections within a parent "alternative" section. In programming terms, it's akin to nested loops, but I'm uncertain if that's the right approach for a sequence diagram. I plan to conduct additional research to better understand how to refine it. My aim is to simplify the flow by breaking down the nested structure into a series of sequential choices, creating a more detailed step-by-step representation of the entire process.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I kicked off the project by carefully analyzing the interview transcript, jotting down every deliverable mentioned by the client. To filter out external requirements, I set aside anything that couldn't be directly addressed through software. For abstract concepts like "security," I delved into research to find applicable solutions. The next step involved translating these requirements into the software design. I broke down each task into its simplest components, creating individual use cases. To reintroduce complexity, I established include and extend relationships. User needs played a crucial role in this process. For instance, the client wanted exclusive downloadable content, so I ensured the design incorporated a login system and tiered user access. This approach aligns the software closely with the client's intentions, preventing the pitfalls of later rework and ensuring client satisfaction.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

In my software development approach, I start by thoroughly reviewing requirements and creating a checklist of essentials. I then identify system objects and their interactions, using UML Class Diagrams or quick notes. Transitioning to process diagrams, I refine my understanding before returning to class diagrams. Once both are in place, I dive into coding. These diagrams prove invaluable, helping me catch potential oversights. While time constraints in school sometimes lead me to jump straight into coding, I recognize the importance of incorporating activity diagrams extensively in the future. They offer a robust framework for outlining function behavior and ensuring expected outcomes.
